# Rambutan

Rambutan is a vertical slide control. Minimal styling, minimal options. Rambutan automatically resizes to the dimensions of the parent element (see the styling).

The contents of the background (or before) and foreground (or after) can be images, backgrounds, colors or HTML elements.

## Juxtapose

This vertical slider is heavily inspired by: [Juxtapose](https://github.com/NUKnightLab/juxtapose). Because Juxtapose is aimed at (mostly horizontal) images, Rambutan fills the need for a more bare-bones approach.
